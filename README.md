# project-RockPaperScissors

This is a small practice project implementing teh classic Rock Paper Scissors game. The goal of this project was to practice basic programming concepts related to **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## ✨ Features

- play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer
- a person wins, when the person has 5 points
- after a game you can restart the game (or even in between)
- Rock Paper Scissors are also visualized

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – structure and semantic layout
- **CSS3** – styling and responsive grid design
- **JavaScript** – calculator logic and interactivity

## 🔄 Possible Improvements

- Improve the randomness of the computer's choice, as the current implementation does not produce evenly distributed results
